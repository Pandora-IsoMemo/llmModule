\usage{
new_RemoteLlmApi(
  api_key_path,
  provider,
  no_internet = NULL,
  exclude_pattern = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{api_key_path}{Character string specifying the path to a file containing the API key.}

\item{provider}{Character string specifying the provider for the API key. Must be either "OpenAI" or "DeepSeek".}

\item{no_internet}{Logical, indicating whether to skip internet checks. If `TRUE`,
the function will not attempt to validate the API key via a network request.}

\item{exclude_pattern}{Character, a regex pattern to exclude certain models from the list of
available models, e.g. "babbage|curie|dall-e|davinci|text-embedding|tts|whisper"}
}
\value{
An object of class RemoteLlmApi, containing the API key, URL, and provider name
 (either "OpenAI" or "DeepSeek"), or a list with an "error" attribute if construction fails.
}
\description{
The new_RemoteLlmApi() function constructs an S3 object that stores API credentials for interacting
with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT models and DeepSeek models.
It reads the API key from a specified file, validates its format, ensures it matches the correct provider,
and checks if the key is valid by performing a test request.
}
\details{
This function includes multiple validation steps:
- Reads the API key from the specified file.
- Ensures the API key format is correct (e.g., OpenAI keys start with "sk-" and DeepSeek keys contain alphanumeric characters).
- Matches the API key to the correct provider.
- Prevents incorrect combinations of API keys and providers.
- Sends a test request to verify that the API key is active and functional.

If any of these checks fail, an error is returned with details about the issue.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create API credentials for OpenAI
api <- new_RemoteLlmApi(api_key_path = "path/to/openai_key.txt", provider = "OpenAI")

# Create API credentials for DeepSeek
api <- new_RemoteLlmApi(api_key_path = "path/to/deepseek_key.txt", provider = "DeepSeek")

# Print the API object
print(api)
